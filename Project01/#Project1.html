        One day one of my new friend from the 
        school introduced me to her at the corridor.
        This where the story starts.When i first looked at her, 
        she was a chubby girl looking at me and kind of smiling.
        I was to shy to say even a "hi" to her.I had zero experience with girls. 
        After that the awkward meeting ended.I liked the way she smiled at me.
        We were in the same class but in different sections.
        When ever i saw her i watched her for distance never had the balls to talk to her.
        She finished school in 2016 but i did in 2017.
        Because i could not attend the final term exam in 2016.

        One day late in 2017 in was using facebook and suddenly saw her profile
        in it.It made me happy for somehow.So i send her a friend request.
        She accepted my friend request.So i texted her and later found out she didn't 
        remembered me.It sucked.We both got admitted in different colleges.I texted her once or twice in every month.We became friends.
        After a couple of months i saw her selfie with her boyfriend on facebook, 
        but she never told me that she had a boyfriend.I was sad and frustrated.
        But i never showed her that i had more interest than being just friends with her.
        At the end of 2018 they broke up.I texted her after that but she didn't 
        replied to my text too much.We started texting each other less and less.

        After a while i saw her a post of pudding on her facebook day.
        So i commented some thing like "ohh that looks delicious and you didn't 
        even invite me to taste it".She asked me to meet after her college.
        that she offered me a treat instead of that pudding.
        I was kind of shocked and happy at the same time because going
        to see her after a long time.I asked for her number and she gave it to me.
        The meeting date was 11th september 2019.
        That day i was 1 hour late when i arrived at her college location.
        So i called her she told me she was standing on the other side of the road.
        I crossed the road and went close to her.When she saw me she waved at me 
        and said "hi".I said "hi" to her as a reply.Then we went to a restaurant.
        We were sitting in front of each other.She ordered a pizza.The whole 
        time i was watching her and she noticed that.We started chatting,
        we continued chatting for almost 3 hours.I gave her a small gift.It was 
        a turtle.In the middle of the conversation i found out she was stalking
        my facebook id and read the whole facebook conversation first to last 
        before meeting me.The whole chatting with her was fun and i laughed a lot
        when i found out she was checking on me.Then we said good bye to each other.
        From that i knew she was interested in me.After that we texted each other
        more than ever.Two days later on 13th september i shared my feelings with her and she accepted
        my feelings for her.

        26th september was our 2nd meeting and also 1st date.That i was 
        late too she was waiting for me beside a foot over bridge.I called
        her few times and searching for her it was in evening and she was kind 
        of scared.I bought some roses for her.After i found her i gave her roses.
        She was nervous to take the roses in the public place.We went to a coffee
        shop.Before that on the way i bought her some balloons.Those were small 
        balloons with sticks.I ordered two cold coffees.We were chatting and 
        laughing.I was watching her the whole time like the 1st day.It always
        made her uncomfortable.When leaving the coffee shop we were playing
        balloons fight.I really enjoyed that.
